# Optimization-CMA-ES

With the programming language R a problem from the field of machine learning is to be examined and solved with an optimization algorithm: Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for Gaussian process models. We herefore used the Covariance Matrix Adaption - Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) as the optimization algorithm.
